## Milestone One Review

This milestone required me to write a single report that describes conceptual modelling and a conceptual model for the case study database. This to include the rationale for the choices I made as I undertook to produce and present a conceptual model of the database from the case study. I started off with researching into what conceptual modelling is, its purpose, and the steps involved. This would be useful for future assessments as I had an understanding of what it was that I was creating and when I would use it. This proved to be useful when I was designing my conceptual diagrams as I knew the steps involved in creating one.

After determining what conceptual modelling was, I then researched into what the components are in conceptual modelling, relationships, optionality of a relationship, cardinality, and participation constraints. This information would prove to be useful in the design of my database as I understood the purpose of each component, as well as when and how to implement it. It was also both interesting and useful researching the different types of participation as this is something the I hadn't covered prior. This knowledge is useful as we often have weak entities in our database designs which require us to implement total participation constraints into our relationships.

Next was one of the more important stages of conceptual design, building the entity relationship diagram (ERD). This would be the foundation of development as it provides an easy to read and understand foundation when developing the logical model. This model took several iterations as there were features that I was missing, areas I could simplify, and ways I reduce the overall complexity of the database. In one of the earlier iterations, I did not use specialization for the user types and subscription types. I thought that I would just use an attribute that determines what type of user they are, and what rights a subscription has. However, I realized that the different user types and subscription types have different relationships within the database. For example, not all of the subscription types have a relationship with the data table. Therefore, I used specialization to create a user and subscription superclass.

The third task involved extracting the information shown in the ERD into three different data dictionary tables. This was a pretty straight forward task that provides a lot of information on what the purpose of each entity is, and when they occur. We also expand on the different attributes of each entity and describe the attribute, its data types, their default values, and more. This is useful as we can look back on these tables when it comes time to design the logical model, as well as implement the physical design.

Although I have stated how these different tasks can be applied in the future, I believe that the logical database design will prove to be more useful when implementing the physical design. However, It is important that we build these models as grounds to designing out logical models.
