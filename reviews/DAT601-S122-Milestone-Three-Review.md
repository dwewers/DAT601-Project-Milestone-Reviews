## Milestone Three Review

This milestone of the assessment was the physical database design and implementation phase. For this milestone, I was required to hand in a single report made up of the reports from the previous milestones into one report. The report was to include the rationale for the choices I made and undertook to produce and present a physical design and implementation of the database from the case study, and report on the tasks described for this milestone. This would be useful for future assessments as I had an understanding of what it was that I was creating and how it would likely be implemented. I was required to implement a database that will support the requirements in the case study, which included ten transactions. The tasks involved with this milestone were as follows:

**Build the database in SQL Server**: This involved taking my logical model and converting each table and relation to DDL to create my physical implementation. This was a fast process as all of the design decisions were already made prior to this milestone. However, I did make some minor changes to attribute names and data types (integer to decimal). This was an important step in my development as a software developer as it further developed my knowledge around implementing a database design in another area that I wasn't fully familiar with. I believe with more time I could further enhance the design and find areas for improvement, but at this stage my design worked for its purpose and at this stage does not throw any errors.

**Generate and load appropriate test data**: This was a pretty straight forward task. The rubric states that there should be a minimum of 100 rows across all the tables and no table should contain less than 5 rows. I made sure that I achieved this by using Mockaroo  to generate test data where possible. However, there was some test data that I had to enter manually. I don't believe that this task was hugely beneficial to my learning in its self, but was required for further tasks that would assist my learning.

**Write and run a set of SQL queries**: This was the main task of this milestone. We were presented ten transactions in the case study that we needed to perform. These had specific instructions as to what data needed to be passed in and the expected result of each transaction. Although this part was time consuming, I did not find it overly difficult. I was able to use prior SLQ experience to create each of the stored procedures/transactions easily, with minimal struggle. I believe with more time, these could be further refined and refactored to perform the tasks more efficiently. However, the transactions performed as required and I was satisfied with the results. I believe that this was beneficial to my learning as it was additional practice to what we had learned in previous papers. By doing a task multiple times, it helps embed the knowledge and makes it easier to implement future tasks.

**Document any significant problem**: I had minimal problems with this milestone as most of the decisions had been made prior to this milestone. I had already analyzed details of the database and could justify the decisions I had made. The only significant problem I overlooked was defining the latitude and longitude in my design for the sensor table as integers. I am not sure how I made this error as I had defined them as decimals in the data table, so it was an odd mistake. This was easily fixed as I just needed to define them as a decimal when creating the DDL.

Overall I believe that this milestone was very useful for my development as a software developer. There was many new things that I learned throughout this process and will hopefully be able to use these learned skills in projects to come.
