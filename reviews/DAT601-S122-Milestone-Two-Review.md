## Milestone Two Review

This milestone of the assessment was the logical database design phase. For this milestone, I was required to write a single report that describes the transformation from a conceptual to a logical model for the case study database. The report was to include the rationale for the choices I made and undertook to produce and present a logical model of the database from the case study. This would be useful for the physical implementation of my database as well future assessments as I had an understanding of what it was that I was creating and how it would likely be implemented. There was several aspects that was required for the report which were to include all working documents as I undertook the following:

**Describing the transformation process:** This involved determining the different notations used in the logical ERD model, defining a set of mapping rules, and listing a step-by-step guide when converting from a conceptual model to a logical model. Of the tasks required for this milestone, I believe that this was the most useful for applying this knowledge to future assessments and other side projects. This provided me with a good understanding of what components are found in the logical model as well as key rules that must be followed in the conversion. The most important rule that I needed to follow in my conversion was the one where a “many” to “many” relationship requires us implement an associative entity (join table).

**Creating an ERD:** This step involved taking my conceptual model and converting it to a logical model. This step was a timely process that required me to make several iterations and come changes to the relationships to ensure that everything made sense and would achieve what is needed for each transaction. This process involved following the rules stated previously to ensure that my model was correct and was accurate to what a model should look like. This was good practice for future designs as I picked up on key skills from mistakes I had made, whether it was design mistakes or contradicted what I stated in my mapping rules (and step-by-step process). I also needed to accompany this model with the rationale behind my decisions. This was to demonstrate how I applied the “mapping rules” from the Conceptual to the Logical Model.

**Normalisation:** This step required me to include a description of normalisation to 4th Normal form (Including Boyce-Codd (BCNF)) as well as making sure that my relationships were fully normalised. This didn't take much time to achieve as most of my model was already normalised. However, It was interesting researching into the different levels of normalisation. This research will likely be useful when designing databases in the future.

**Data Dictionary:** Like the previous milestone, I was required to document the logical model in a data dictionary. This was pretty straight forward, however, it was very time consuming as I had so many entities and attributes to document. In my opinion, this task isn't that useful for developing the physical implementation, but would be useful if you were trying to explain the design to someone else such as a stakeholder.

**NaLER:** The final task was to perform a NaLER analysis. This is essentially pseudo code for databases. This is a very useful skill to learn as we can give this to someone and they can easily create a model base off of this. The only thing that this doesn't explain is the data types and the data sizes. 

Overall I believe that this milestone was very useful for my development as a software developer. There was many new things that I learned throughout this process and will hopefully be able to use these learned skills in projects to come.
